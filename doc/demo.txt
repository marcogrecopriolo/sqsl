SQSL demo scripts documentation					May 15, 2008

Several scripts are provided in the doc directory that demonstrate some of
the structured query scripting language capabilities.

databases.sqsl, tables.sqsl, index.sqsl, columns.sqsl and users.sqsl
provide dbaccess or onmonitor like reports listing, unsurprisingly, all the
databases in an instance, all the tables in a database (choosen through a drop
down list), all the columns or indexes in a table (selected through two drop
down lists...) and all the users and related rights in a database.

Workload1.sqsl and workload2.sqsl demonstrate ways to quickly set up
multiple processes all connecting to a single database and generating sql
load. The first script uses a hash of prepared statements, while the second
uses the expansion facility.

Migrate.sqsl demontrates parallel data transfer across two engines using output
redirection.
All scripts are fully functional, with the exception of migrate.sqsl which
requires specifying a few items like source and target instance, database and
tables before it can be used.

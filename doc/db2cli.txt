SQSL CLI DB2 data source V0.9 release notes			Jan 5, 2009

This data source ought to be considered alpha:- I really haven't tested it
that much. This is my excuse for the sketchy documentation.
I will probably go over it again one day. Then again, given my current track
record, chances are that I will not.

Build problems
The bulk of those arises from the DB2 environment being incorrectly set.
Hopefully the build script ought to terminate early, but it is not uncommon
to see that the C compiler tries to link Informix header files rather than DB2.

Connection options
I haven't found a way to implement exclusive connections. If you need those,
use the db2sqc source. In principle you should be able to use the db2cli and
db2sqc sources at the same time, however whether this works for you or not
very much depends on the DB2 version you are using, and is beyond my control.

SQL additions
Altough not really part of V7 DB2 UDB advertised SQL syntax, this source does
support the CHANGE ISOLATION statement. SET CURRENT ISOLATION has made it in
V8 anyhow.

Further features
Decimals, dates, times and timestamps are converted onto the corresponding
Informix types on the fly, and viceversa.

Limitations
As stated earlier, EXCLUSIVE connections are not implemented at this time.
DB2 has a limit of one connection per database per process, although,
unlike the db2 clp, connections can be renamed.

SQSL N1QL data source V0.1 release notes			Mar 31, 2017

The couchbase N1QL data source is as alpha as it gets, in fact not even that.
Proof of concept, really.
There is enough code to select entire documents and support data loading
from other database engines, but is missing authentication, options,
final response handling and json parser.

Building hints
As long the configure script can locate libcouchbase, the source should build
out of the box.
On windows, the build process will only work with the dynamically linked
version on libcouchbase.
This gets chosen automatially and there no action required on your part.

Limitations
...most things are not implemented!

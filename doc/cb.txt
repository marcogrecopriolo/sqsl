SQSL N1QL data source V0.9 release notes			Jul 13, 2019

The couchbase N1QL data source is fairly stable, but probably not production
ready.
A couple of things might not work here and there because describing fields
and collecting errors work unlike any relational database engine, due to the
json in / json out nature of the product.
I believe I have covered most things.

Building hints
As long the configure script can locate libcouchbase, the source should build
out of the box.
On windows, the build process will only work with the dynamically linked
version on libcouchbase.
This gets chosen automatially and there no action required on your part.

Limitations
DML performance might not be great - this has more to do with N1QL
than this source.
Unicode sequences are not implemented.

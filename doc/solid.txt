SQSL SolidDB data source V0.1 release notes			Dec 23, 2009

This data source ought to be considered alpha:- I really haven't tested it
that much. This is my excuse for the sketchy documentation.
I will probably go over it again one day. Then again, given my current track
record, chances are that I will not.

Build problems
As long as the location of SolidDB is known (all that's needed is the ability
to run solsql) the source should build out of the box.
This said, the impression I get is that the Solid run-time libraries might have
different names depending on the product version. If this is the case, you can
quickly determine what to link from the makefile in samples/odbc found in  the
SolidDB installation directory.
As of this writing, on Windows ports, I haven't managed to properly convert
the SolidDB ODBC library into an archive, hence it currently builds, but it's
likely to segv your client.
If you have a Microsoft Visual Studio installation lying around, there's a
windows batch file in tools/mvs (aptly named solid.bat) that will build the
solid source using it.

Connection options
I haven't found a way to implement exclusive connections.

Further features
Decimals, dates, times and timestamps are converted onto the corresponding
Informix types on the fly, and viceversa. Currently the conversion is done
using charecter strings as middleman, as it appears Solid isn't happy
selecting any of the above in anything other that character buffers.

Limitations
As stated earlier, EXCLUSIVE connections are not implemented at this time.
Nor I have found a way to implement with hold cursors.

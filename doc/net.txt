SQSL network data streams  V0.1 release notes			Mar 31, 2017

This library provides a mechanism to open, read from and write to from network
connections.

At this moment in time, it only allows streams via sockets.
This is done by means of a function named 'tcp' that connects to a specific
host (ip address or FQDN) and port (service or number) and returns a (SQSL)
file descriptor from which is then possible to read from and write to, in 
the usual fashion. 

Usage example

LET fd = socket:tcp(host, port);
READ FROM fd PATTERN DELIMITED;

Building hints
This has only tested on Windows and Linux, but should work out of the box
in POSIX compliant operating systems.
